Bosskey (part of the Chrome Toolbox) changed so it works on the new Chrome.

The old Chrome Toolbox unless already installed previously says:
"This application is not supported on this computer. Installation has been disabled."

Old code retrieved (and changed) from https://code.google.com/p/chrome-toolbox/
